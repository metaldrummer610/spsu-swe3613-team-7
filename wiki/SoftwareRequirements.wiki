#summary Requirements for building the project
#labels Featured

To build the project, the following applications are required:
  * g++
  * make
  * subversion (svn)
  * postgresql
  * libpqxx
  * boost (in libs folder)
  * enet (in libs folder)
  * fltk (in libs folder)
  * libx11-dev


Steps to build:
  # Build the Boost libraries
   # Run tar -xvf on boost_1_47_0.tar.bz2
   # Run a ./bootstrap.sh
   # Run a sudo ./b2 install
  # Build the fltk libraries
   # Run a tar -xvf on fltk-1.3.0-source.tar.gz
   # Run a ./configure
   # Run a make
   # Run a sudo make install
  # Build the enet libraries
   # Run tar -xvf on enet-1.3.3.tar.gz
   # Run a ./configure
   # Run a make
   # Run a sudo make install
  # Build the common library
   # Move into the common directory
   # Run make
  # Build the server
   # Move into the server directory
   # Run make
  # Build the client
   # Move into the client/fltk directory
   # Run make

To run the server, run a "make run" from the server directory, or execute the "server" binary in the server/bin/ folder.

To run the client, run a "make run" from the client/fltk directory, or execute the "client" binary in the client/fltk/bin directory.

Running "make clean" in either the common, server, or client/fltk directories will clean up the binaries from the respective folder.
