= Project Overview =

Based on the email we received from Joseph, the requirements we have for this project are as follows:
  * We need a drop down list that contains all the codes that have been used (These are the DX codes)
    * If the user cannot find the code they are looking for in the previous list, the user must search for that code
  * We need a screen that allows the user to search the database for ICD10 codes based on either ICD9 code, description of the ICD9 code, ICD10 code, or description of the ICD10 code
    * If the user selects a code from this page, then a "Create DX Code" page needs to be displayed so that we can add the selected code to the drop down list above
  * At some point, combine all this functionality into a single window
