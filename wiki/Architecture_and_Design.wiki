= Introduction =

This is a skeleton page for architecture and design discussions. We'll modify it when we get here.


= Details =

==Programming languages:==
  * We discussed on 8-25-11 what programming language(s) we should use. We came up with, but made no decision on:
    * Java
    * C++
    * C# (If we're doing a desktop only client)
  * *UPDATE 9/06/13*
   ** We have decided that we will write this project in C# (for the client side) and C++ (for the server side)


==Architecture:==
  * We also discussed on 8-25-11 what the overall design of the application should be. We discussed, but did not decide on:
    * A client-server model, where we would have a database on the server
    * A desktop only client, with no database.
    * A web application (which will probably not happen)
  * *UPDATE 9/06/13*
   ** We have decided that the project will be a client server architecture. The client will run on Windows, while the server will run on Linux (specifically Ubuntu 11.04).
