# Release 4 - 10/4/11 #
**Very large note! Because of the midterm in class, this release will be delayed another week. This is because we had to study for the midterm and had no time to work on the project.**

  * The fourth iteration of the project will focus on getting the GUI completed and all of our documentation squared away. There are a few minor additions to the network library and to the server that will aid in client side functionality

Breaking down the work between members:
| **Member** | **Responsible For:** |
|:-----------|:---------------------|
| Robbie | Adding any network requirements that are required |
| Jeff | Adding extra queries to the server for the database |
| Greg | Figuring our Palorian and getting documentation into the system |
| David | Working on the GUI |
| Kevin | Communicating with the client to insure all requirements will be met |

All of the release tracking from now on will be done in Pivotal Tracker.
