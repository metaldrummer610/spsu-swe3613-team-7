# ICD Overview #

From what I can tell, there are some files that are available called "GEMs". These gems are basically mappings between ICD-9 and ICD-10. Also, I found that the correct term for the conversion process is to "crosswalk" from ICD-9 to ICD-10.

I believe that if we download these files and learn how to use them, then we can use them in our app for our database. If we can do this, then we can just write a desktop app instead of a networked app.

CMS - Organization that handles the ICD numbers.  **Downloadable txt file of conversion codes.**  This looks like data we will want to parse into a database to use in our program.  **Note: 2012 GEM isn't posted.  Go to 2011 CM or PCS and look for "General Equivalency Mappings".  These are the actual conversions we will need.**
