# User Stories #

  * As a PC user, I want to be able to access the system quickly and get results quickly so that no time is spent wasted.

  * As a doctor, I want the system to be stable so that patients and doctors do not get frustrated.

  * As an insurance person, I want the system to be up 5NINES so that the downtime is minimized.

  * As an insurance person, I want to receive accurate, concurrent results so that there is no confusion and errors.

  * As a nurse, I want an easy to use system and interface so that errors are minimized and less time will be spent training operators of it.

  * As a nurse, I want to only have one input box so that the process is simplified.

  * As a nurse, I want there to be a list of most commonly (locally) used codes so that input can be swifter.

  * As a doctor, I want to limit the areas of the body that are applicable to the office so that no extra ICD10 codes come up that are not within the scope of the office.

  * As a hospital manager, I want the system to be able to support multiple simultaneous requests so that there is no wait queue for using the service.

  * As a nurse I want to be able to search by description, ICD9 code, or DXCode in one text box so that the system is easier to use.

  * As a nurse, I want to be able to notify the software creators if there is ever an error so that they can fix it and prevent the error from happening at other places.

  * As a nurse, I want the system to display descriptions on all ID10 codes so that I know that I get right code.

  * As an insurance person, I want to be able to check the ICD10 > ICD9 code result so that I can double-check the accuracy of the system and reaffirm the result.

  * As a nurse, I want a pleasant interface yet not over-the-top so that using the system is more pleasant but does not drain the system resources.

  * As a person without 20/20 eye sight, I want to adjust the font size so that it is easier for me to view.

  * As a busy nurse, I want there to be an android/iOS app for this so that I do not have to go to a computer all the time.

  * As a nurse, I want the system to either sync with the insurance application process, or offer me a “copy” button so that imputing the ICD10 code into the Insurance form is easier and faster.

  * As a new nurse, I want the system to display which part of the body or organs the ICD10 code refers to so that I am sure that I am not making a mistake.



## Reminder ##

Remember that not all of these have to be fulfilled. This is our product backlog and some features are more important than others. Some of the listed features are also intended for potential future releases (particularly Android and iOS app). It is highly possible that not all of these will be implemented by our final release.

Also, this is written considering that the Nurse is the main user of this system hospital-side. Doctors and trainees and other people may also use it and desire the features marked "as a nurse".
